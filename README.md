# Social Media Feed Backend for University & Corporate Galleries

## Project Overview

PhotoCampus is a modern photo gallery platform designed to revolutionize how universities and companies share and preserve memories. Our primary goal is to abolish traditional paper-based yearbooks by providing a digital alternative that's more accessible, interactive, and environmentally friendly.

This backend solution focuses on creating a scalable GraphQL API that supports high-volume photo collections, user interactions, and targeted content delivery. Unlike general social media platforms, PhotoCampus is specifically tailored for educational institutions and corporate environments, making it easier to find and connect with classmates, colleagues, and alumni.

### ðŸ‘¥ User Access & Interaction

-   Public university pages accessible to all users
-   Private company/organization pages accessible via invitation only
-   Comment, like, and share functionality with social media integration
-   User-friendly compared to general social media platforms

### ðŸ”„ Connectivity & Business Features

-   Connect with classmates and colleagues within specific institutional contexts
-   Invitation system for private corporate galleries

-   Analytics for user engagement and content popularity

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

-   **Backend Framework**: Django
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL
-   **API Layer**: GraphQL with Graphene
-   **Testing Interface**: GraphQL Playground
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

### GraphQL API Features

The GraphQL API provides flexible querying capabilities:

-   **Optimized Queries**: Efficiently load posts with related comments and likes
-   **Advanced Filtering**: Search and filter posts by multiple criteria
-   **Real-time Interactions**: Like, comment, and share functionality
-   **User Authentication**: JWT-based secure authentication
-   **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for efficient data loading
-   **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation

For detailed API documentation, see [GraphQL API Guide](graphql_api_guide.md).

### Database Schema

The database is optimized for high-volume photo storage and user interactions:

-   Users and profiles with permission levels
-   Universities and companies as organization entities
-   Photo collections with metadata and privacy settings
-   Comments, likes, and shares with efficient counter caching
-   Invitations and access control mechanisms

### GraphQL Implementation

Our GraphQL API enables:

-   Flexible querying of photos with filter options
-   Complex data fetching in a single request
-   Real-time updates for user interactions
-   Schema-defined API that's self-documenting


## GraphQL Playground

The API includes a hosted GraphQL Playground for easy testing and exploration:

-   Interactive documentation of the entire schema
-   Real-time query composition and execution
-   Authentication testing capabilities
-   Shareable query collections for team collaboration

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   PostgreSQL
-   pipenv or venv

### Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository
    
    `git clone git@github.com:AbelBekele/PhotoCampus.git`
    
2.  Install dependencies

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
3.  Configure database settings in `settings.py`
5.  Run migrations
    
    `python manage.py migrate`
    
6.  Start the development server
    
    `python manage.py runserver`
    
7.  Access GraphQL Playground at `http://localhost:8000/graphql/`

## Testing with pytest

The project includes comprehensive pytest-based tests for the GraphQL API. These tests cover all aspects of the API, including authentication, post management, comments, likes, and shares.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, make sure you have installed all dependencies (including development dependencies) and have a running server:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest test_graphql.py -v

# Run specific test modules or functions
pytest test_graphql.py::test_login -v
pytest test_graphql.py::test_create_post -v

# Run tests with specific markers
pytest test_graphql.py -m "parametrize" -v
```

### Configuration

The test suite uses environment variables for configuration. You can set these in a `.env` file in the project root:

```
# .env file example
TEST_USERNAME=testuser
TEST_EMAIL=testuser@example.com
TEST_PASSWORD=securepassword123
TEST_SKIP_USER_CREATION=false
GRAPHQL_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/graphql/
```

### Test Categories

The tests are organized into the following categories:

1. **Authentication Tests**
   - User creation
   - Login and token management
   - User profile retrieval

2. **Post Management Tests**
   - Creating, updating, and deleting posts
   - Querying posts with various filters
   - Search functionality

3. **Interaction Tests**
   - Comments (creating and deleting)
   - Likes (liking and unliking posts)
   - Shares (sharing posts to different platforms)

### Fixtures

The test suite includes several useful fixtures:

- `test_user`: Creates a test user for authentication tests
- `auth_token`: Provides an authentication token for protected endpoints
- `test_post`: Creates a temporary post for testing interactions
- `test_comment`: Creates a temporary comment for testing

### Adding New Tests

To add new tests:

1. Define the GraphQL query or mutation at the top of the file
2. Create a test function using pytest's conventions
3. Use the existing fixtures for authentication and data setup
4. Add assertions to validate the expected behavior

## Performance Optimizations

-   Database query optimization for high-volume photo collections
-   Efficient counter caching for interaction metrics
-   Pagination strategies for large result sets
-   Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields
-   Denormalization where appropriate for performance

# Social Media Feed Backend for University & Corporate Galleries

## Project Overview

PhotoCampus is a modern photo gallery platform designed to revolutionize how universities and companies share and preserve memories. Our primary goal is to abolish traditional paper-based yearbooks by providing a digital alternative that's more accessible, interactive, and environmentally friendly.

This backend solution focuses on creating both a scalable GraphQL API and RESTful API that supports high-volume photo collections, user interactions, and targeted content delivery. Unlike general social media platforms, PhotoCampus is specifically tailored for educational institutions and corporate environments, making it easier to find and connect with classmates, colleagues, and alumni.

-   Universities and companies as organization entities
-   Photo collections with metadata and privacy settings
-   Comments, likes, and shares with efficient counter caching
-   Invitations and access control mechanisms
-   Optimized indexes for frequently queried fields
-   Constraints to maintain data integrity

## GraphQL Playground

The API includes a hosted GraphQL Playground for easy testing and exploration:

-   Interactive documentation of the entire schema
-   Real-time query composition and execution
-   Authentication testing capabilities
-   Shareable query collections for team collaboration

## Swagger UI

The REST API is fully documented with Swagger UI:

-   Interactive API documentation
-   Test endpoints directly from your browser
-   Authentication support for protected endpoints
-   Request/response examples for all endpoints

Access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/swagger/`

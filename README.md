# Social Media Feed Backend for University & Corporate Galleries

## Project Overview

PhotoCampus is a modern photo gallery platform designed to revolutionize how universities and companies share and preserve memories. Our primary goal is to abolish traditional paper-based yearbooks by providing a digital alternative that's more accessible, interactive, and environmentally friendly.

This backend solution focuses on creating both a scalable GraphQL API and RESTful API that supports high-volume photo collections, user interactions, and targeted content delivery. Unlike general social media platforms, PhotoCampus is specifically tailored for educational institutions and corporate environments, making it easier to find and connect with classmates, colleagues, and alumni.
